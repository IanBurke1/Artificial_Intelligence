# Using Simulated Annealing to Break a Playfair Cipher
#### *Artificial Intelligence - Lecturer: Dr John Healy - 4th Year (Hons) Software Development, GMIT*
For my project in Artifical Intelligence, I am required to use the simulated annealing algorithm to break a Playfair Cipher. The application should have the following minimal set of features:

- A menu-drivencommand line UI that enables a cipher-text source to be specified (a file or URL) and an output destination file for decrypted plain-text.
- Decrypt cipher-text with asimulated annealing algorithm that uses a log-probability and n-gram statistics as a heuristic evaluation function. 

## How to run
#### Run on eclipse
1. Download the zip.
2. Unzip the repository.
3. Import Simulated Annealing project folder into eclipse

#### Run using command terminal
1. Download the zip
2. Unzip the repository
3. Open command terminal
4. Enter the following:
```Linux
java -cp ./playfair.jar ie.gmit.sw.ai.CipherBreaker
```
